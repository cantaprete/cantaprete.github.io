Since I was a kid I tried to keep a personal diary but somehow, sooner rather than later, I always fail.

Here I keep some collections: a journal; a book log of what I read, what I'm reading (and maybe someday what I'm planning to read); and a list of those things that I'll never fail to appreciate.

Journals clearly have something charming, but I think that lists are undervalued.  There are exaustive lists, like my book log, but I'm talking about lists that, at least as per the author intention, are not trying to describe something thoroughly, but rather suggest it.  Like a painting.  Considering I hate hyper-realism paintings, I clearly prefer this last type of list.
