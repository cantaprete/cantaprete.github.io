I'm still building the website while forcing myself to use Emacs as much as possible.  I like its potentialities, I like thinking I'm using a software that, at least in principle, I can keep using until I'm on my death bed without huge changings[^1].  However, it's impossible to hide how _difficult_ it is.  I'm picking up how to move between files and inside those I've opened, I'm learning how to use some shortcuts to automate what I can, but at the same time there are a few things that work one way but not on the other.

So I keep switching from one software to the other, I solve a problem, I get myself on top of another one.  Slowly (very slowly) it's taking shape, and I have to say that it's time for the first commit.

[^1]: Or maybe any change since, instead of alternatives such as Visual Studio Code, I'm pretty sure that from here on I'll always be able to find a copy of Emacs 29.4.
