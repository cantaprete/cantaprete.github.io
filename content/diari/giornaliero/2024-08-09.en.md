I did the first commit and I'm satisfied with the results.  I started with the localization of the website and it's harder than I though.  There are a million tiny things I have to fix, and it seems like every page I open the todo list doubles in length.  I'm sure that once I'll have everything in place keeping the website updated will be easier; right now, though...

Working here in the mountains is ideal for these kind of projects.  Life is slow, there are few distractions, and even the lack of a proper internet connection (my phone's hotspot is the only link to the civilized world) is a pro rather than a con.  I can work the hours I have to do for Renato, and then I spend the rest of the time by fixing the website and doing my things.

The only thing is that compared to the other week, my sleep is a bit worse.  Last night I think I woke up because of some noise upstair.  Something must have fallen, or maybe is the house moving.

Anyway, for now I've decided that I'll keep updating this journal on a daily basis, and translate each entry as soon as I publish them.
