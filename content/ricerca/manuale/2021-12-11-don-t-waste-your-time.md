I: _You have some wonderful stories of basically getting away with stuff at the studios._

MB: I’d learned one very simple trick: say yes. Simply say yes. Like Joseph E. Levine, on _The Producers_, said, “The curly-haired guy—he’s funny looking. Fire him.” He wanted me to fire Gene Wilder. And I said, “Yes, he’s gone. I’m firing him.” I never did. But he forgot. After the screening of _Blazing Saddles_, the head of Warner Bros. threw me into the manager’s office, gave me a legal pad and a pencil, and gave me maybe twenty notes. He would have changed _Blazing Saddles_ from a daring, funny, crazy picture to a stultified, dull, dusty old Western. He said, “No farting.” I said, “It’s out”… You say yes, and you never do it.

I: _That’s great advice for life._

MB: It is. Don’t fight them. Don’t waste your time struggling with them and trying to make sense to them. They’ll never understand.
