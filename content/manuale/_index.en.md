In 2006, while I was in South Romania, I got lost in the country between Levski and Nikolaevka.  I reached a canal, and a man about thirty years old gave me a ride on his boat.

It was small and contained everything he owned.  Inside some huge books were benting a shelf under their weight.  They were sitting in the best spot, he explained to me, which meant as far from water as they could.  Nevertheless, some of them had their back badly mended.  The man cleaned his hands by brushing them on his side, then with great care he picked the first of the row and he opened it under my nose.

Here and there there were handwritten phrases, but most of the pages were filled by small pieces of paper cut from newspapers, magazines, books.  The man said that one had been made by his grandfather.  He used to call it "Manual de viață", something like "life handbook", and it was filled with quotes and things like that about living well, with honor and everything.

Two of those volumes were his grandfather's, while the rest were his uncles' that year after year had kept the tradition alive.  The last two were his father's, and he had inherited them along with the boat a few months earlier.  On a board nailed to the walls there was his own, and a few pages were already filled up.
