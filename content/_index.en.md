As you can see from my name, I'm not British, American, or from any other English-speaking country.  My first language is Italian, and each and every content on this website has been translated to English from the original Italian version, and thus it may sound weird here and there (or even wrong).  My English is good enough, but not perfect, and I have to say the same for myself: the Italia version of myself is better than the English one[^1].

This website, in some form or another, exists since 2012, or maybe 2013.  For most of the time it's been a blog, for the rest some sort of... portfolio?  I'm not sure how to define it, but let's say that the only way I could justify to myself the existence of this space was by telling what I was doing and what I already did.  Let's say it was some sort of self-advertising.  The problem with a website like that is that only a specific kind of content can be published.  This is the problem with any website built for a specific use-case.

I wanted an alternative to the social networks.  I wanted something that didn't necessairly look trendy (or, well, that looked somewhat reactionary to those trends), that didn't had to adhere to some structure imposed from the top but something I coould choose without worrying whether what I was about to publish could fit in.

To be honest, the idea isn't really original.  Part of the inspiration comes from the website of professor P.K.[^2], as he was used to sign his letters.  I was lucky enough to meet him and unlucky enough to enjoy his intelligence for so little.  He called this "Stimmgabel für Seelen".  In the end, I'm afraid, it will look like a memex, but that's not what I'm after.

Anyway, you can get in touch <a href="mailto:&#106;&#097;&#099;&#111;&#112;&#111;&#064;&#106;&#097;&#099;&#111;&#112;&#111;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#046;&#105;&#116;">by writing me an e-mail</a>.
