This collection was born from seven lyrics written by Roberto Roversi so that Lucio Dalla could use them in his songs. The band Zois wrote published the album [Etilene per tutti](https://open.spotify.com/album/1QybcF90CeMdhmNUgLuNDM), while us (Silvia Brizio, Silvia Cadonici, Eugenio Fallarino, Nicola Longhi, Silvana Miano, Valentina Misgur, Luca Palladino, and I) used them as a source of inspiration for short stories.
