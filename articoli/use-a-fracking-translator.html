                  <p>Those who belong to an Anglophone culture cannot
                  imagine the frustration felt by the rest of the world
                  when trying to communicate beyond the narrow circle
                  defined by those who speak our language.</p>
                  <p>The sensation is a layering of many things. There
                  is, for instance, the difficulty in speaking a
                  language different from your own, both in terms of the
                  time required to mentally translate a concept<a
                  href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                  role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and in terms of
                  keeping every peculiarity in mind. But there’s also
                  the frustration of not being able to express a thought
                  with the same nuances that our minds feel.</p>
                  <p>I speak English. I can express myself and
                  understand, but this is not <em>my</em> language. If I
                  wrote what I think in English, surely my potential
                  audience would be broader, but it would also be
                  narrower. To paraphrase what someone from my past once
                  said, you don’t know how intelligent I am in my own
                  language. We aren’t truly ourselves in a borrowed
                  language.</p>
                  <p>The situation becomes even more absurd when we
                  consider the technological level of the devices we
                  spend 90% of our time with. Whether you use Chrome,
                  Safari, or Firefox, you have the ability to
                  automatically translate a page’s text. So why do we
                  keep writing in English?</p>
                  <p>The reason we non-native English speakers continue
                  to write in a language that isn’t ours is that we know
                  humans are lazy. I could say that we know <em>you</em>
                  won’t use a translator, but that would be a lie
                  because even <em>we</em> don’t use it. Perhaps we
                  don’t do it because we feel the result would be
                  something unreadable, but in reality, today’s worst
                  translation software would do a better job than
                  someone like me trying to run a marathon in shoes that
                  don’t fit.</p>
                  <p>And even if something went wrong, even if at some
                  point the AI you fed my text to started hallucinating
                  absurd meanings, isn’t it better to discover something
                  misinterpreted than to read something dumbed down?</p>

                  <li id="fn1"><p>This is true for anyone who didn’t
                  grow up bilingual, meaning for all brains that, during
                  a specific developmental window, weren’t exposed to
                  the stimulus of two different languages. Of course,
                  there are exceptions, but these exceptions lie on a
                  spectrum rather than being a clear divide between
                  those with a gift for languages and those without.
                  While this mental translation may be unconscious, it’s
                  still present. You might have grown up in one country
                  and lived for fifty years on another continent, but
                  just as your brain will never forget its first
                  language, it will never fully believe the one it’s
                  spoken for half a century.<a href="#fnref1"
