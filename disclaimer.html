        <h1>For those who don't speak Italian</h1>
        
        <p>Anglophones can't really understand what online- and computer-life is like for those who didn't grow up in an English speaking country.  Learning a new language is great, but it never fully solves the problem.</p>
        <p>Everytime you're going to make something you find yourself asking "should I use my language, knowing that fewer people will understand it and that inside it will always be a two-languages-Frankenstein, or do I use <em>their</em> language?".  I can only start imaging how does it feel for those who don't even use the latin alphabet.</p>
        <p>When I started this website I asked myself that question.  This is a personal website, something that really wants to stay off the radar.  I don't feel like promoting myslef here, but still I'd love to have readers.  Never trust a writer who says they don't want to share their writings with the world.  English, though, is not my language.  I'm Italian.</p>
        <p>The weirdest thing is that while most of anglophones can't even see there's a problem here, they're the ones mostly affected by it.  As there's a multitude of great films once you start accepting the existence of subtitles, so there's a sea of content when you know more than one language.</p>
        <p>The best thing would be for you to learn our languages.  We learned English, you can learn ours.  There's a reason why those who doesn't speak English as their first language most often than not speaks (or at least understand) more than one language.  But even if you don't feel like learning a language, we're living in the tech era, you know?</p>
        <p>If you use Safari on mobile, you can always translate a page by clicking down left on the address bar and tapping on Translate.  It even keeps translating the website after you click a link.  And if you use Chrome, there surely is a way to use Google Translate since Google never waste the chance to push their services.</p>
        <p>So, why are you still reading English-only content?</p>
