    <h1>Don&#39;t fight them. Don&#39;t waste your time</h1>
    <p>I: <em>You have some wonderful stories of basically getting away with stuff at the studios.</em></p>
<p>MB: I’d learned one very simple trick: say yes. Simply say yes. Like Joseph E. Levine, on <em>The Producers</em>, said, “The curly-haired guy—he’s funny looking. Fire him.” He wanted me to fire Gene Wilder. And I said, “Yes, he’s gone. I’m firing him.” I never did. But he forgot. After the screening of <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, the head of Warner Bros. threw me into the manager’s office, gave me a legal pad and a pencil, and gave me maybe twenty notes. He would have changed <em>Blazing Saddles</em> from a daring, funny, crazy picture to a stultified, dull, dusty old Western. He said, “No farting.” I said, “It’s out”… You say yes, and you never do it.</p>
<p>I: <em>That’s great advice for life.</em></p>
<p>MB: It is. Don’t fight them. Don’t waste your time struggling with them and trying to make sense to them. They’ll never understand.</p>
